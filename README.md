A Sudoku solver program in C++ uses a backtracking algorithm to solve Sudoku puzzles. Sudoku is a number puzzle game played on a 9x9 grid, divided into 3x3 subgrids called "regions." The goal is to fill the grid with digits from 1 to 9, such that each row, each column, and each 3x3 subgrid contains all the digits from 1 to 9 without repetition.
